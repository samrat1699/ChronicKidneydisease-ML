## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains medical data related to chronic kidney disease. It includes features such as age, blood pressure, and various blood test results. The dataset is available at [link-to-dataset](link-to-dataset).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronic-kidney-disease-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chronic-kidney-disease-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, run the main script: `python main.py`
2. The script will preprocess the data, train different machine learning models, and display evaluation metrics.

## Models

We have implemented and evaluated the performance of the following machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Detailed results and analysis for each model can be found in the project report.
